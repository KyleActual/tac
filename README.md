## AREA OF OPERATIONS 
![overhead view](/opZoneMapF.png)

This involves transportation requirements as well as taking into consideration the fact that reaching the area of operations with all necessary equipment means transporting it in a different configuration than it will e worn in - meaning we need to walk into the woods looking like people on a hike and be able to quickly transition to plate carriers, assemble weapons, and operate drones etc. And, of course, ultimately we need to drive back home so everything must transition back as well. We did the gist of this in Raleigh alot so it won't be entirely new. 

Things to consider immediately - 

The required items we need to bring, and logistically how is it going to happen.

Choose the configuration of our gear and commit to that - meaning every item has a pocket/pouch/location/etc. and we know immediately where any one item is at any given time. Also things worn on our backs should include things the other person may need to access quickly but are difficult to carry in an accesible fashion - like bolt cutters, smoke grenades, drones or drone parts, and whatever else would be more practical to deploy this way. 

Things that arent waterproof probably should be. 

We both have to have at least one sort of illumination device whether it be a flashlight, headlamp, gunlight, and regardless of time of day. AND it should be somewhere or in a way in which it cannot be turned on accidentally. 

We should be able to/ expecting to operate with cellphones turned off.

We need to have reliable comms. Lol our white whale. And of course a multi tier plan in place should we lose visual contact with one another. In full camoflauge and in dense foliage this is almost guaranteed to happen probably more than once. Yelling should be the last resort lol.
